                        <p class="pr"><span class="par">O</span>ne of the most famous IPL franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) entered the IPL auction 2023 with a strong squad after retaining key players from the draft earlier this year. They only released five players before the Cochin auction on Dec. 23, the fewest of any team.
                         The Bengaluru-based franchise, which has one of cricket’s most devoted fans, entered the auction with a net worth of 8.75 crores. RCB retained 18 players from their 2022 squad.</p>
                            
                         <p class="pr"> With RCB having a strong 2022 season and reaching the knockout stages, most of the RCB retained players are in the squad for IPL 2023. The table below has all the RCB retained players.</p>
                         <p class="pr">RCB have suffered a huge double injury as fast bowler Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Rajat Patidar are doubted for IPL 2023. Both players have become a vital part of the RCB squad as they both were RCB retained players. RCB will play their first match against MI on 2nd April.</p>

                    <p class="pr"><span style="font-size: 3.2rem;">C</span>hennai Super Kings vs Lucknow Super Giants IPL 2023 Highlights: Chennai’s four-year-long wait for its Thala MS Dhoni and CSK finally ended with a sensational win against Lucknow Super Giants on Monday. Chennai Super Kings batters, including special cameo by Dhoni, made the most of the batting that came to them first after Lucknow Super Giants chose to bowl first after winning the toss. During the after-match ceremony, LSG skipper KL Rahul did admit that the team made certain mistakes.</p>

                       <p class="pr"> Initially, LSG looked very much in commanding position. They even bettered the power play numbers against Chennai Super Kings. But as soon as Dhoni decided to bring in Moeen Ali, it was a downhill for LSG from there on. Along with Mitch Santner, Ali demolished the batting lineup of Super Giants. He took major wickets including LSG captain KL Rahul, Marcus Stoinis and very in-form Kyle Mayers.</p></td>
